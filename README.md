# MLOps Assignment 1: Dataset Versioning & Privacy

This repository contains my work for the MLOps assignment 1 involving dataset versioning, model training, and differentially private machine learning using tools like DVC and lakeFS.

## Contents
- Data cleaning and transformation for two dataset versions (v1 and v2)
- Model training using scikit-learn and TensorFlow (with and without differential privacy)
- Version control and data tracking using both DVC and lakeFS
- Comparative analysis of tooling and privacy impacts

## Acknowledgements
Some parts of this assignment were completed with the assistance of AI tools, including **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot**, particularly for troubleshooting, and code debugging.
